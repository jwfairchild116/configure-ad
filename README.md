- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

<h2>Setting up Azure Enviornment </h2>

<p>
The first thing we are going to do is create a resource group, you can do this while creating the VM but I will demonstrate how to do it manually. Click on Resource Groups, if it is not there use the search bar at the top of the screen. Click on create in the upper left corner of the screen. On the next screen we are going to name our resource group ‚ÄúADDS_Lab‚Äù which stands for Active Directory Domain Services. For the region I will be selecting West US 2. You can proceed by selecting Review and Create, then Create. You will be taken back to the resource group page, you may need to refresh in order to see it. You will also have a notification in the upper right corner saying ‚Äú Resource Group Created‚Äù
</p>

<p> For this section we will do the following 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a resource group called ‚ÄúADDS_Lab</li>
  <li>Create a Virtual Network called ‚ÄúADVNET</li>
  <li>Create a virtual machine with windows server called ‚ÄúDC-1‚Äù</li>
<li> Create a virtual Machine with Windows 10 called ‚ÄúClient1‚Äù
</ul>

<p> This image is what is shown when you log into azure </p>

<p> The first thing we're going to do is create a resource group. You can do this while creating the VM, but I will demonstrate how to do it manually.

Click on Resource Groups. If you don't see it, use the search bar at the top of the screen. Click on Create in the upper-left corner of the screen.

On the next screen, name your resource group "ADDS_Lab", which stands for Active Directory Domain Services. For the region, I will be selecting West US 2.

Proceed by selecting Review + Create, then click Create. You will be taken back to the Resource Groups page‚Äîyou may need to refresh to see it. A notification will also appear in the upper-right corner saying "Resource Group Created. </p>

<p> Now we are going to create a Virtual Network. This will allow our VMs to communicate with each other. Again, this can be done while creating the virtual machines, but I will show you how to do it manually. </p>
<p> From the home page, select Virtual Networks, or type it into the search bar at the top. </p>
 <p> On the Create virtual network screen, make sure the ADDS_Lab resource group is selected. We are going to name this virtual network "ADVNET". Once again, we'll stick with West US 2 as the region. </p>
<p> I‚Äôm not going to modify the settings on the following screens, so I will select Review + Create, then click Create. </p>

<p> You‚Äôll be taken to a screen that says "Your deployment is complete." </p>

<p> Now we are going to create our virtual machines. </p>
<p> From the home page, select Virtual Machines, then click Create. A drop-down menu will appear‚Äîselect ‚ÄúAzure Virtual Machine.‚Äù </p>
<p> On the next screen, use the drop-down menu to select the ADDS_Lab resource group. Name the VM DC-1, and set the region to ‚ÄúWest US 2.‚Äù
For the image, select Windows Server 2022. </p>
<p> üîß Note: I‚Äôve experienced an issue where I couldn't select the VM size and received an error. To work around this, I selected ‚ÄúAzure selected zone (preview),‚Äù which then allowed me to choose a size. </p>
<p> Make sure to select at least 2 vCPUs. While doing the labs for CourseCareers, I made the mistake of selecting only 1 vCPU, and performance was very slow.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: If you're on the Azure trial plan, you have a limit of 4 vCPUs total. Only select 2 vCPUs to avoid hitting that cap. I mistakenly selected 4 the first time and had to start over.
For the credentials: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Username: LabUSER</li>
  <li>Password:CyberLab1234</li>
</ul>
<p> Click Next, then Next again to proceed to the Networking tab.
On the Networking tab, make sure the virtual network is set to ADVNET.
Click Review + Create, and if validation passes, click Create.
‚è≥ This process may take a few minutes. </p>
 <p>Once you reach the ‚ÄúDeployment in progress‚Äù screen, repeat the process to create a second VM. This time:
‚Ä¢	Name it: Client-1
‚Ä¢	Image: Select Windows 10
‚Ä¢	Keep it in the same resource group and virtual network
‚ö†Ô∏è On the Windows 10 VM setup screen, you will need to confirm licensing. Make sure to check the box at the bottom, or the validation will fail. </p>
<p> Now that both VMs are created, we‚Äôll do a few more things. First, we‚Äôll get the public IP addresses of both VMs. You can find these under Virtual Machines, where they are listed next to each VM. These IP addresses will be used for Remote Desktop connections. </p>

<p> Now, on your Windows machine, open the Start menu by clicking the Start button or pressing the Windows key on your keyboard. Type "RDP", which stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. (You can also type "Remote Desktop," but I find "RDP" quicker.) </p>
<p> Open the Remote Desktop Connection app. </p>
<p> Next, enter the IP address of the VM you want to connect to‚Äîthe one we collected earlier. </p>
<p>Click "More choices" or "Use a different account" and log in using the credentials you created earlier: </p>
‚Ä¢	Username: LabUSER
‚Ä¢	Password: CyberLab1234
<p> Let the two virtual machines finish logging in. This may take some time, especially since it‚Äôs the first time they're being set up. </p>
<p> Once connected to the Windows 10 VM, go through the standard Windows setup process as prompted. </p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Azure Screen "/>

<p> Now we are going into the Windows Server VM. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell by searching for ‚ÄúCMD‚Äù or ‚ÄúPowerShell‚Äù in the Start menu. Type ipconfig and find the local IP address listed under IPv4. In this case, the IP address is 10.0.0.5. Next, go into Azure and select ‚ÄúClient1‚Äù under Virtual Machines. In the side panel, expand ‚ÄúNetworking‚Äù and select ‚ÄúNetwork Settings.‚Äù Click on ‚ÄúNetwork Interface / IP Configuration.‚Äù In the side panel that appears, look under ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and select ‚ÄúDNS Servers.‚Äù Choose ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù and add the IP address of the DC-1 server. This step is necessary so the client machine will look to the server for DNS, which is required for joining a domain. Once that is done, click Save. Then restart the VM by going to the Virtual Machines page, selecting Client1, and confirming ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to restart. Your Remote Desktop session will be disconnected, which is normal. We only accessed the VM initially to complete the lengthy setup process. Once the restart is complete, log back into the VM and open PowerShell. Type ipconfig /all to verify that the DNS is now pointing to the server. That wraps up our Azure setup. The next section will cover how to set up a domain controller. </p>
